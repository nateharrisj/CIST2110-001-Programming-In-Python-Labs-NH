#Lab 9
# Author: Nate Harris

"""_summary_

This lab is designed to create a simple web application using streamlit and create a simple Date counter using datetime.
"""

# 1. We will first need to activate and install streamlit.
# pip install streamlit

# 2. Import streamlit here as st and datetime as dt

import streamlit as sl
import datetime as dt


# 3. Create a title for your web application. Streamlit has a function for this called title

sl.title("Date Counter")


# 4. Create a subheader for your web application. Streamlit has a function for this called subheader

sl.subheader("Enter a date to calculate the number of days until that date")

# 5. Create a date input for the user to enter a date. Streamlit has a function for this called date_input
# Make sure to save the input into a variable

date = sl.date_input("Enter a date: ", format="MM/DD/YYYY")

# 6. Create a button for the user to click. Streamlit has a function for this called button
# Make sure to save the button click into a variable

button = sl.button("Calculate")

# 7. Create a function that will calculate the number of days until the date entered by the user.
# You will need to use the datetime library for this.
# You will need to convert the user input into a datetime object.
# You will need to get the current date and convert it into a datetime object.
# You will need to subtract the current date from the user input date.
# You will need to return the number of days.
# The function should take in a datetime.date as a parameter.
# The function should return an integer.
# The function should be called calculate_days

def calculate_days(date) -> int:
    """Calculate the number of days until the date entered by the user.

    Args:
        date (datetime.date): The date entered by the user.

    Returns: 
        int: The number of days until the date entered by the user.
    """
    current_date = dt.datetime.now().date()
    days_diff = date - current_date
    if days_diff.days < 0:
        raise ValueError("The date entered is in the past") 
    return days_diff.days



# 8. Create an app function that will run the web application.
# Check if the button has been clicked, then call the calculate_days function and pass in the date entered by the user. Use a try except block to catch any errors.
# Save the result into a variable.
# Print out the result.

def app():
    if button:
        try:
            result = calculate_days(date)
            sl.write(result)
        except ValueError:
            sl.write("Please enter a future date")
            return
        sl.write(f"Current Date: {dt.datetime.now().date()}")
        sl.write(f"Date Entered: {date}")
        sl.write(f"Days until date entered: {result}")


# 9. Run the web application by typing streamlit run Lab9.py in the terminal.
# 10. Enter a date in the format of YYYY-MM-DD and click the button. I change the format to MM-DD-YYY
# 11. Check to see if the number of days until the date entered is correct.
# 12. If the number of days is correct, then you have completed the lab.
# 13. If the number of days is incorrect, then you will need to debug your code.
